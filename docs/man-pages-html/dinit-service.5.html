<p class="Pp">The service description files for <b>Dinit</b> each describe a
    service. The name of the file corresponds to the name of the service it
    describes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Service description files specify the various attributes of a
    service. A service description file is named after the service it
    represents, and is a plain-text file with simple key-value format. The
    description files are located in a service description directory; by
    default, the system process searches <i>/etc/dinit.d</i>,
    <i>/usr/local/lib/dinit.d</i> and <i>/lib/dinit.d</i>, while a user process
    searches <i>$HOME/.config/dinit.d</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">All services have a <i>type</i> and a set of <i>dependencies</i>.
    These are discussed in the following subsections. The type, dependencies,
    and other attributes are specified via property settings, the format of
    which are documented in the <b>SERVICE PROPERTIES</b> subsection, which also
    lists the available properties.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="SERVICE_TYPES"><a class="permalink" href="#SERVICE_TYPES">SERVICE
  TYPES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are four basic types of service:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>Process</b> services. This kind of service runs as a single process;
      starting the service simply requires starting the process; stopping the
      service is accomplished by stopping the process (via sending it a
    signal).</li>
  <li><b>Bgprocess</b> services (&quot;background process&quot; services). This
      kind of service is similar to a regular process service, but the process
      daemonizes or otherwise forks from the original process which starts it,
      and the process ID is written to a file. Dinit can read the process ID
      from the file and, if it is running as the system init process, can
      supervise it.</li>
  <li><b>Scripted</b> services are services which are started and stopped by a
      command (which need not actually be a script, despite the name). They can
      not be supervised.</li>
  <li><b>Internal</b> services do not run as an external process at all. They
      can be started and stopped without any external action. They are useful
      for grouping other services (via service dependencies).</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Independent of their type, the state of services can be linked to
    other services via dependency relationships, which are discussed in the next
    section.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="SERVICE_DEPENDENCIES"><a class="permalink" href="#SERVICE_DEPENDENCIES">SERVICE
  DEPENDENCIES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A service dependency relationship, broadly speaking, specifies
    that for one service to run, another must also be running. The first service
    is the <i>dependent</i> service and the latter is the <i>dependency</i>
    service (we will henceforth generally refer to the the dependency
    relationship as the <i>relationship</i> and use <i>dependency</i> to refer
    to the service). A dependency relationship is specified via the properties
    of the dependent. There are different relationship types, as follows:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>A <b>need</b> (or &quot;hard&quot;) relationship specifies that the
      dependent must wait for the dependency to be started before it starts, and
      that the dependency must remain started while the dependent is started.
      Starting the dependent will start the dependency, and stopping the
      dependency will stop the dependent. This type of relationship is specified
      using a <b>depends-on</b> property.</li>
  <li>A <b>milestone</b> relationship specifies that the dependency must start
      successfully before the dependent starts. Starting the dependent will
      therefore start the dependency. Once started, the relationship is
      satisfied; if the dependency then stops, it has no effect on the
      dependent. However, if the dependency fails to start or has its startup
      cancelled, the dependent will not start (and will return to the stopped
      state). This type of relationship is specified using a <b>depends-ms</b>
      property.</li>
  <li>A <b>waits-for</b> relationship specifies that the dependency must start
      successfully, or fail to start, before the dependent starts. Starting the
      dependent will attempt to first start the dependency, but failure will not
      prevent the dependent from starting. If the dependency starts, stopping it
      will have no effect on the dependent. This type of relationship is
      specified using a <b>waits-for</b> property.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Note that process-based services always wait for their dependency
    relationships to be satisfied (by the dependency starting, or failing to
    start in case of a waits-for relationship) before their process is launched.
    Conversely, a termination signal will not in general be sent to a service
    process until the service has no active dependents.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since in general dependencies should remain started so long as
    their dependent does, an attachment forms between the two once both are
    started. This attachment is released when the dependent stops, and the
    dependency will then stop, unless it has other attachments or it has been
    explicitly started independently. Attachments between a dependent and
    dependency are re-created if a dependency starts (or starts again) while the
    dependent is still started.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="SERVICE_PROPERTIES"><a class="permalink" href="#SERVICE_PROPERTIES">SERVICE
  PROPERTIES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This section described the various service properties that can be
    specified in a service description file. The properties specify the type of
    the service, dependencies of the service, and other service
  configuration.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each line of the file can specify a single property value,
    expressed as `<i>property-name</i> = <i>value</i>'. Comments begin with a
    hash mark (#) and extend to the end of the line (they must be separated from
    setting values by at least one whitespace character). Values are interpreted
    literally, except that:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>White space (comprised of spaces, tabs, etc) is collapsed to a single
      space, except leading or trailing white space around the property value,
      which is stripped.</li>
  <li>Double quotes (&quot;) can be used around all or part of a property value,
      to prevent whitespace collapse and prevent interpretation of other special
      characters (such as &quot;#&quot;) inside the quotes. The quote characters
      are not considered part of the property value.</li>
  <li>A backslash (\) can be used to escape the next character, causing it to
      lose any special meaning and become part of the property value. A double
      backslash (\\) is collapsed to a single backslash within the parameter
      value.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Setting a property generally overrides any previous setting (from
    prior lines). However some properties are set additively; these include
    dependency relationships and <b>options</b> properties.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following properties can be specified:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="type"><a class="permalink" href="#type"><b>type</b> = {process |
    bgprocess | scripted | internal}</a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the service type; see the <b>SERVICE TYPES</b> section.</dd>
  <dt id="command"><a class="permalink" href="#command"><b>command</b> =
    <i>command-string</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the command, including command-line arguments, for starting the
      process. Applies only to <b>process</b>, <b>bgprocess</b> and
      <b>scripted</b> services.</dd>
  <dt id="stop"><a class="permalink" href="#stop"><b>stop-command</b> =
    <i>command-string</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the command to stop the service (optional). Applicable to
      <b>process</b>, <b>bgprocess</b> and <b>scripted</b> services. If
      specified for <b>process</b> or <b>bgprocess</b> services, the &quot;stop
      command&quot; will be executed in order to stop the service, instead of
      signalling the service process.</dd>
  <dt id="working"><a class="permalink" href="#working"><b>working-dir</b> =
    <i>directory</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the working directory for this service. For a scripted service,
      this affects both the start command and the stop command. The value is
      subject to variable substitution (see <b>VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION</b>).</dd>
  <dt id="run"><a class="permalink" href="#run"><b>run-as</b> =
    <i>user-id</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies which user to run the process(es) for this service as. Specify
      as a username or numeric ID. If specified by name, the group for the
      process will also be set to the primary group of the specified user.</dd>
  <dt id="env"><a class="permalink" href="#env"><b>env-file</b> =
    <i>file</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a file containing value assignments for environment variables,
      in the same format recognised by the <b>dinit</b> command's
      <b>--env-file</b> option (see <b>dinit</b>(5)). The file is read (or
      re-read) whenever the service is started; the values read do not affect
      for the processing performed for the <b>sub-vars</b> load option, which is
      done when the service description is loaded. The precise behaviour of this
      setting may change in the future. It is recommended to avoid depending on
      the specified file contents being reloaded whenever the service process
      starts.
    <p class="Pp">The path specified is subject to variable substitution (see
        <b>VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION</b>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="restart"><a class="permalink" href="#restart"><b>restart</b> = {yes |
    true | no | false}</a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates whether the service should automatically restart if it stops,
      including due to unexpected process termination or a dependency stopping.
      Note that if a service stops due to user request, automatic restart is
      inhibited.</dd>
  <dt id="smooth"><a class="permalink" href="#smooth"><b>smooth-recovery</b> =
    {yes | true | no | false}</a></dt>
  <dd>Applies only to <b>process</b> and <b>bgprocess</b> services. When set
      true/yes, an automatic process restart can be performed without first
      stopping any dependent services. This setting is meaningless if the
      <b>restart</b> setting is set to false.</dd>
  <dt id="restart~2"><a class="permalink" href="#restart~2"><b>restart-delay</b>
    = <i>XXX.YYYY</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the minimum time (in seconds) between automatic restarts.
      Enforcing a sensible minimum prevents Dinit from consuming a large number
      of process cycles in case a process continuously fails immediately after
      it is started. The default is 0.2 (200 milliseconds).</dd>
  <dt id="restart~3"><a class="permalink" href="#restart~3"><b>restart-limit-interval</b>
    = <i>XXX.YYYY</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Sets the interval (in seconds) over which restarts are limited. If a
      process automatically restarts more than a certain number of times
      (specified by the <b>restart-limit-count</b> setting) in this time
      interval, it will not be restarted again. The default value is 10
    seconds.</dd>
  <dt id="restart~4"><a class="permalink" href="#restart~4"><b>restart-limit-count</b>
    = <i>NNN</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the maximum number of times that a service can automatically
      restart over the interval specified by <b>restart-limit-interval</b>.
      Specify a value of 0 to disable the restart limit. The default value is
    3.</dd>
  <dt id="start"><a class="permalink" href="#start"><b>start-timeout</b> =
    <i>XXX.YYY</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the time in seconds allowed for the service to start. If the
      service takes longer than this, its process group is sent a SIGINT signal
      and enters the &quot;stopping&quot; state (this may be subject to a stop
      timeout, as specified via <b>stop-timeout</b>, after which the process
      group will be terminated via SIGKILL). The timeout period begins only when
      all dependencies have been stopped. The default timeout is 60 seconds.
      Specify a value of 0 to allow unlimited start time.</dd>
  <dt id="stop~2"><a class="permalink" href="#stop~2"><b>stop-timeout</b> =
    <i>XXX.YYY</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the time in seconds allowed for the service to stop. If the
      service takes longer than this, its process group is sent a SIGKILL signal
      which should cause it to terminate immediately. The timeout period begins
      only when all dependent services have already stopped. The default timeout
      is 10 seconds. Specify a value of 0 to allow unlimited stop time.</dd>
  <dt id="pid"><a class="permalink" href="#pid"><b>pid-file</b> =
    <i>path-to-file</i></a></dt>
  <dd>For <b>bgprocess</b> type services only; specifies the path of the file
      where daemon will write its process ID before detaching. Dinit will read
      the contents of this file when starting the service, once the initial
      process exits, and will supervise the process with the discovered process
      ID. Dinit may also send signals to the process ID to stop the service; if
      <b>dinit</b> runs as a privileged user the path should therefore not be
      writable by unprivileged users.
    <p class="Pp">The value is subject to variable substitution (see <b>VARIABLE
        SUBSTITUTION</b>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="depends"><a class="permalink" href="#depends"><b>depends-on</b> =
    <i>service-name</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This service depends on the named service. Starting this service will
      start the named service; the command to start this service will not be
      executed until the named service has started. If the named service is
      stopped then this service will also be stopped.</dd>
  <dt id="depends~2"><a class="permalink" href="#depends~2"><b>depends-ms</b> =
    <i>service-name</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This service has a &quot;milestone&quot; dependency on the named service.
      Starting this service will start the named service; this service will not
      start until the named service has started, and will fail to start if the
      named service does not start. Once the named (dependent) service reaches
      the started state, however, the dependency may stop without affecting the
      dependent service.</dd>
  <dt id="waits"><a class="permalink" href="#waits"><b>waits-for</b> =
    <i>service-name</i></a></dt>
  <dd>When this service is started, wait for the named service to finish
      starting (or to fail starting) before commencing the start procedure for
      this service. Starting this service will automatically start the named
      service. If the named service fails to start, this service will start as
      usual (subject to other dependencies being met).</dd>
  <dt id="waits~2"><a class="permalink" href="#waits~2"><b>waits-for.d</b> =
    <i>directory-path</i></a></dt>
  <dd>For each file name in <i>directory-path</i> which does not begin with a
      dot, add a <b>waits-for</b> dependency to the service with the same name.
      Note that contents of files in the specified directory are not
      significant; expected usage is to have symbolic links to the associated
      service description files, but this is not required. Failure to read the
      directory contents, or to find any of the services named within, is not
      considered fatal.
    <p class="Pp">The directory path, if not absolute, is relative to the
        directory containing the service description file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="after"><a class="permalink" href="#after"><b>after</b> =
    <i>service-name</i></a></dt>
  <dd>When starting this service, if the named service is also starting, wait
      for the named service to finish starting before bringing this service up.
      This is similar to a <b>waits-for</b> dependency except no dependency
      relationship is implied; if the named service is not starting, starting
      this service will not cause it to start (nor wait for it in that
    case).</dd>
  <dt id="before"><a class="permalink" href="#before"><b>before</b> =
    <i>service-name</i></a></dt>
  <dd>When starting the named service, if this service is also starting, wait
      for this service to finish starting before bringing the named service up.
      This is largely equivalent to specifying an <b>after</b> relationship to
      this service in the named service (but the relationship
      &quot;belongs&quot; to this service and so will be removed if this service
      is unloaded, for example).</dd>
  <dt id="chain"><a class="permalink" href="#chain"><b>chain-to</b> =
    <i>service-name</i></a></dt>
  <dd>When this service terminates (i.e. starts successfully, and then stops of
      its own accord), the named service should be started. Note that the named
      service is not loaded until that time; naming an invalid service will not
      cause this service to fail to load.
    <p class="Pp">This can be used for a service that supplies an interactive
        &quot;recovery mode&quot; for another service; once the user exits the
        recovery shell, the primary service (as named via this setting) will
        then start. It also supports multi-stage system startup where later
        service description files reside on a separate filesystem that is
        mounted during the first stage; such service descriptions will not be
        found at initial start, and so cannot be started directly, but can be
        chained via this directive.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The chain is not executed if the initial service was
        explicitly stopped, stopped due to a dependency stopping (for any
        reason), if it will restart (including due to a dependent restarting),
        or if its process terminates abnormally or with an exit status
        indicating an error. However, if the <b>always-chain</b> option is set
        the chain is started regardless of the reason and the status of this
        service termination.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="socket"><a class="permalink" href="#socket"><b>socket-listen</b> =
    <i>socket-path</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Pre-open a socket for the service and pass it to the service using the
      <b>systemd</b> activation protocol. This by itself does not give so called
      &quot;socket activation&quot;, but does allow any process trying to
      connect to the specified socket to do so immediately after the service is
      started (even before the service process is properly prepared to accept
      connections).
    <p class="Pp">The path value is subject to variable substitution (see
        <b>VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION</b>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="socket~2"><a class="permalink" href="#socket~2"><b>socket-permissions</b>
    = <i>octal-permissions-mask</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Gives the permissions for the socket specified using <b>socket-listen</b>.
      Normally this will be 600 (user access only), 660 (user and group access),
      or 666 (all users). The default is 666.</dd>
  <dt id="socket~3"><a class="permalink" href="#socket~3"><b>socket-uid</b> =
    {<i>numeric-user-id</i> | <i>username</i>}</a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the user (name or numeric ID) that should own the activation
      socket. If <b>socket-uid</b> is specified as a name without also
      specifying <b>socket-gid</b>, then the socket group is the primary group
      of the specified user (as found in the system user database, normally
      <i>/etc/passwd</i>). If the <b>socket-uid</b> setting is not provided, the
      socket will be owned by the user id of the <b>dinit</b> process.</dd>
  <dt id="socket~4"><a class="permalink" href="#socket~4"><b>socket-gid</b> =
    {<i>numeric-group-id</i> | <i>group-name</i>}</a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the group of the activation socket. See discussion of
      <b>socket-uid</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="term"><a class="permalink" href="#term"><b>term-signal</b> = {none |
    HUP | INT | TERM | QUIT | USR1 | USR2 | KILL}</a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the signal to send to the process when requesting it to
      terminate (applies to `process' and `bgprocess' services only). The
      default is SIGTERM. See also <b>stop-timeout</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="ready"><a class="permalink" href="#ready"><b>ready-notification</b> =
    {<b>pipefd:</b><i>fd-number</i> |
    <b>pipevar:</b><i>env-var-name</i>}</a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the mechanism, if any, by which a process service will notify
      that it is ready (successfully started). If not specified, a process
      service is considered started as soon as it has begun execution. The two
      options are:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>pipefd:</b><i>fd-number</i> &#x2014; the service will write a message
      to the specified file descriptor, which <b>dinit</b> sets up as the write
      end of a pipe before execution. This mechanism is compatible with the S6
      supervision suite.</li>
  <li><b>pipevar:</b><i>env-var-name</i> &#x2014; the service will write a
      message to file descriptor identified using the contents of the specified
      environment variable, which will be set by <b>dinit</b> before execution
      to a file descriptor (chosen arbitrarily) attached to the write end of a
      pipe.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="logfile"><a class="permalink" href="#logfile"><b>logfile</b> =
    <i>log-file-path</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the log file for the service. Output from the service process
      (standard output and standard error streams) will be appended to this
      file. This setting has no effect if the service is set to run on the
      console (via the <b>runs-on-console</b>, <b>starts-on-console</b>, or
      <b>shares-console</b> options). The value is subject to variable
      substitution (see <b>VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION</b>).</dd>
  <dt id="options"><a class="permalink" href="#options"><b>options</b> =
    <i>option</i>...</a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies various options for this service. See the <b>OPTIONS</b>
      section. This directive can be specified multiple times to set additional
      options.</dd>
  <dt id="load"><a class="permalink" href="#load"><b>load-options</b> =
    <i>load_option</i>...</a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies options for interpreting other settings when loading this
      service description. Currently there is only one available option,
      <b>sub-vars</b>, which specifies that command-line arguments (or parts
      thereof) in the form of <b>$NAME</b> should be replaced with the contents
      of the environment variable with the specified name. See <b>VARIABLE
      SUBSTITUTION</b> for details. Note command-line variable substitution
      occurs after splitting the line into separate arguments and so a single
      environment cannot be used to add multiple arguments to a command line. If
      a designated variable is not defined, it is replaced with an empty
      (zero-length) string, possibly producing a zero-length argument.
      Environment variable variables are taken from the environment of the
      <b>dinit</b> process, and values specified via <b>env-file</b> or
      <b>ready-notification</b> are not available. This functionality is likely
      to be re-worked or removed in the future; use of this option should be
      avoided if possible.</dd>
  <dt id="inittab"><a class="permalink" href="#inittab"><b>inittab-id</b> =
    <i>id-string</i></a></dt>
  <dd>When this service is started, if this setting (or the <b>inittab-line</b>
      setting) has a specified value, an entry will be created in the system
      &quot;utmp&quot; database which tracks processes and logged-in users.
      Typically this database is used by the &quot;who&quot; command to list
      logged-in users. The entry will be cleared when the service terminates.
    <p class="Pp">The <b>inittab-id</b> setting specifies the &quot;inittab
        id&quot; to be written in the entry for the process. The value is
        normally quite meaningless. However, it should be distinct (or unset)
        for separate processes. It is typically limited to a very short
      length.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The &quot;utmp&quot; database is mostly a historical artifact.
        Access to it on some systems is prone to denial-of-service by
        unprivileged users. It is therefore recommended that this setting not be
        used. However, &quot;who&quot; and similar utilities may not work
        correctly without this setting (or <b>inittab-line</b>) enabled
        appropriately.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This setting has no effect if Dinit was not built with support
        for writing to the &quot;utmp&quot; database.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="inittab~2"><a class="permalink" href="#inittab~2"><b>inittab-line</b>
    = <i>tty-name-string</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This specifies the tty line that will be written to the &quot;utmp&quot;
      database when this service is started. Normally, for a terminal login
      service, it would match the terminal device name on which the login
      process runs, without the &quot;/dev/&quot; prefix.
    <p class="Pp">See the description of the <b>inittab-id</b> setting for
        details.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="rlimit"><a class="permalink" href="#rlimit"><b>rlimit-nofile</b> =
    <i>resource-limits</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the number of file descriptors that a process may have open
      simultaneously. See the <b>RESOURCE LIMITS</b> section.</dd>
  <dt id="rlimit~2"><a class="permalink" href="#rlimit~2"><b>rlimit-core</b> =
    <i>resource-limits</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the maximum size of the core dump file that will be generated
      for the process if it crashes (in a way that would result in a core dump).
      See the <b>RESOURCE LIMITS</b> section.</dd>
  <dt id="rlimit~3"><a class="permalink" href="#rlimit~3"><b>rlimit-data</b> =
    <i>resource-limits</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the maximum size of the data segment for the process, including
      statically allocated data and heap allocations. Precise meaning may vary
      between operating systems. See the <b>RESOURCE LIMITS</b> section.</dd>
  <dt id="rlimit~4"><a class="permalink" href="#rlimit~4"><b>rlimit-addrspace</b>
    = <i>resource-limits</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the maximum size of the address space of the process. See the
      <b>RESOURCE LIMITS</b> section. Note that some operating systems (notably,
      OpenBSD) do not support this limit; the setting will be ignored on such
      systems.</dd>
  <dt id="run~2"><a class="permalink" href="#run~2"><b>run-in-cgroup</b> =
    <i>cgroup-path</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Run the service process(es) in the specified cgroup (see
      <b>cgroups</b>(7)). The cgroup is specified as a path; if it has a leading
      slash, the remainder of the path is interpreted as relative to
      <i>/sys/fs/cgroup</i>, and otherwise the entire path is interpreted
      relative to the cgroup in which <b>dinit</b> is running (as determined at
      startup or specified by options). The latter can only be used if there is
      only a single cgroup hierarchy (either the cgroups v2 hierarchy with no
      cgroups v1 hierarchies, or a single cgroups v1 hierarchy).
    <p class="Pp">Note that due to the &quot;no internal processes&quot; rule in
        cgroups v2, a relative path must typically begin with &quot;..&quot; if
        cgroups v2 are used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The named cgroup must already exist prior to the service
        starting; it will not be created by <b>dinit</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This setting is only available if <b>dinit</b> was built with
        cgroups support.</p>

<p class="Pp">These options are specified via the <b>options</b> parameter.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="runs"><a class="permalink" href="#runs"><b>runs-on-console</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies that this service uses the console; its input and output should
      be directed to the console (or precisely, to the device to which Dinit's
      standard output stream is connected). A service running on the console
      prevents other services from running on the console (they will queue for
      the console).
    <p class="Pp">Proper operation of this option (and related options) assumes
        that <b>dinit</b> is itself attached correctly to the console device (or
        a terminal, in which case that terminal will be used as the
        &quot;console&quot;).</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <i>interrupt</i> key (normally control-C) will be active
        for process / scripted services that run on the console. Handling of an
        interrupt is determined by the service process, but typically will cause
        it to terminate.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="starts"><a class="permalink" href="#starts"><b>starts-on-console</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies that this service uses the console during service startup. This
      is identical to <b>runs-on-console</b> except that the console will be
      released (available for running other services) once the service has
      started. It is applicable only for <b>bgprocess</b> and <b>scripted</b>
      services.
    <p class="Pp">As for the <b>runs-on-console</b> option, the <i>interrupt</i>
        key will be enabled while the service has the console.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="shares"><a class="permalink" href="#shares"><b>shares-console</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies that this service should be given access to the console (input
      and output will be connected to the console), but that it should not
      exclusively hold the console. A service given access to the console in
      this way will not delay the startup of services which require exclusive
      access to the console (see <b>starts-on-console</b>,
      <b>runs-on-console</b>) nor will it be itself delayed if such services are
      already running.
    <p class="Pp">This is mutually exclusive with both <b>starts-on-console</b>
        and <b>runs-on-console</b>; setting this option unsets both those
        options, and setting either of those options unsets this option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="starts~2"><a class="permalink" href="#starts~2"><b>starts-rwfs</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This service mounts the root filesystem read/write (or at least mounts the
      normal writable filesystems for the system). This prompts Dinit to create
      its control socket, if it has not already managed to do so.</dd>
  <dt id="starts~3"><a class="permalink" href="#starts~3"><b>starts-log</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This service starts the system log daemon. Dinit will begin logging via
      the <i>/dev/log</i> socket.</dd>
  <dt id="pass"><a class="permalink" href="#pass"><b>pass-cs-fd</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Pass an open Dinit control socket to the process when launching it (the
      <i>DINIT_CS_FD</i> environment variable will be set to the file descriptor
      of the socket). This allows the service to issue commands to Dinit even if
      the regular control socket is not available yet.
    <p class="Pp">Using this option has security implications! The service which
        receives the control socket must close it before launching any untrusted
        processes. You should not use this option unless the service is designed
        to receive a Dinit control socket.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="start~2"><a class="permalink" href="#start~2"><b>start-interruptible</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This service can have its startup interrupted (cancelled) if it becomes
      inactive while still starting, by sending it the SIGINT signal. This is
      meaningful only for <b>bgprocess</b> and <b>scripted</b> services.</dd>
  <dt id="skippable"><a class="permalink" href="#skippable"><b>skippable</b></a></dt>
  <dd>For scripted services, indicates that if the service startup process
      terminates via an interrupt signal (SIGINT), then the service should be
      considered started. Note that if the interrupt was issued by Dinit to
      cancel startup, the service will instead be considered stopped.
    <p class="Pp">This can be combined with options such as
        <b>starts-on-console</b> to allow skipping certain non-essential
        services (such as filesystem checks) using the <i>interrupt</i> key
        (typically control-C).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="signal"><a class="permalink" href="#signal"><b>signal-process-only</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Signal the service process only, rather than its entire process group,
      whenever sending it a signal for any reason.</dd>
  <dt id="always"><a class="permalink" href="#always"><b>always-chain</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Alters behaviour of the <b>chain-to</b> property, forcing the chained
      service to always start on termination of this service (instead of only
      when this service terminates with an exit status indicating success).</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" id="RESOURCE_LIMITS"><a class="permalink" href="#RESOURCE_LIMITS">RESOURCE
  LIMITS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are several settings for specifying process resource limits:
    <b>rlimit-nofile</b>, <b>rlimit-core</b>, <b>rlimit-data</b> and
    <b>rlimit-addrspace</b>. See the descriptions of each above. These settings
    place a limit on resource usage directly by the process. Note that resource
    limits are inherited by subprocesses, but that usage of a resource and
    subprocess are counted separately (in other words, a process can effectively
    bypass its resource limits by spawning a subprocess and allocating further
    resources within it).</p>
<p class="Pp">Resources have both a <i>hard</i> and <i>soft</i> limit. The soft
    limit is the effective limit, but note that a process can raise its soft
    limit up to the hard limit for any given resource. Therefore the soft limit
    acts more as a sanity-check; a process can exceed the soft limit only by
    deliberately raising it first.</p>
<p class="Pp">Resource limits are specified in the following format:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>soft-limit</i>:<i>hard-limit</i></div>
<p class="Pp">Either the soft limit or the hard limit can be omitted (in which
    case it will be unchanged). A limit can be specified as a dash, `<b>-</b>',
    in which case the limit will be removed. If only one value is specified with
    no colon separator, it affects both the soft and hard limit.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="VARIABLE_SUBSTITUTION"><a class="permalink" href="#VARIABLE_SUBSTITUTION">VARIABLE
  SUBSTITUTION</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Some service properties specify a path to a file or directory, or
    a command line. For these properties, the specified value may contain one or
    more environment variable names, each preceded by a single `<b>$</b>'
    character, as in `<b>$NAME</b>'. In each case the value of the named
    environment variable will be substituted. The name must begin with a
    non-punctuation, non-space, non-digit character, and ends before the first
    control character, space, or punctuation character other than `<b>.</b>',
    `<b>-</b>' or `<b>_</b>'. To avoid substitution, a single `<b>$</b>' can be
    escaped with a second, as in `<b>$$</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Variables for substitution come from the <b>dinit</b> environment
    at the time the service is loaded. In particular, variables set via
    <b>env-file</b> are not visible to the substitution function.</p>

    run by a script (<i>/etc/dinit.d/rootfscheck.sh</i>). The script may need to
    reboot the system, but the control socket may not have been created, so it
    uses the <b>pass-cs-fd</b> option to allow the <b>reboot</b> command to
    issue control commands to Dinit. It runs on the console, so that output is
