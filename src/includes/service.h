/*
 * This header defines service_record, a data record maintaining information about a service,
 * and service_set, a set of interdependent service records. It also defines some associated
 * types and exceptions.
 *
 * Service states
 * --------------
 * Services have both a current state and a desired state. The desired state can be
 * either STARTED or STOPPED. The current state can also be STARTING or STOPPING.
 * A service can be "pinned" in either the STARTED or STOPPED states to prevent it
 * from leaving that state until it is unpinned.
 *
 * The total state is a combination of the two, current and desired:
 *      STOPPED/STOPPED  : stopped and will remain stopped
 *      STOPPED/STARTED  : stopped (pinned), must be unpinned to start
 *      STARTING/STARTED : starting, but not yet started. Dependencies may also be starting.
 *      STARTING/STOPPED : as above, but the service will be stopped again as soon as it has
 *                         completed startup.
 *      STARTED/STARTED  : running and will continue running.
 *      STARTED/STOPPED  : started (pinned), must be unpinned to stop
 *      STOPPING/STOPPED : stopping and will stop. Dependents may be stopping.
 *      STOPPING/STARTED : as above, but the service will be re-started again once it stops.
 *
 * A scripted service is in the STARTING/STOPPING states during the script execution.
 * A process service is in the STOPPING state when it has been signalled to stop, and is
 * in the STARTING state when waiting for dependencies to start or for the exec() call in
 * the forked child to complete and return a status.
 *
 * Interrupted transitions
 * -----------------------
 * A service that is STOPPING may be issued a start order, or a service that is STARTING may be
 * issued a stop. In some cases a STOPPING or STARTING transition can be interrupted and immediately
 * switch to the other kind of transition. We don't normally want to do this if we're waiting on an
 * external process, since simply killing that process might leave a mess. However, if a service is
 * waiting for its dependencies or dependents, its start or stop can usually be interrupted.
 *
 * Acquisition/release:
 * ------------------
 * Each service has a dependent-count ("required_by"). This starts at 0, adds 1 if the service has
 * explicitly been started (i.e. "start_explicit" is true), and adds 1 for each dependent service
 * which is not STOPPED/STOPPING (including dependents via a "soft" dependency relationship).
 * When required_by transitions to 0, the service is stopped and it will release its own dependencies
 * (unless it is pinned started). Conversely, when required_by transitions from 0 to 1, the service is
 * started and dependencies will be required (unless pinned stopped).
 *
 * In general, therefore, the dependent-count determines the target state (STARTED if the count is greater
 * than 0, otherwise STOPPED). Explicit activation counts effectively increments the count and sets the
 * target state as STARTED.
 *
 * An exception is that setting the target state to STOPPED is used to inhibit restart. This is propagated
 * to dependent services (i.e. their target state will also be set to STOPPED). The required_by count for a
 * service in this scenario will settle to 0 anyway (because dependents will be stopped).
 *
 * Another exception is that a service may become STOPPED while it is still required (for example if a
 * process terminates unexpectedly). This will force hard dependents to stop also, so again, the required_by
 * count will settle to 0, unless the service is active and set to auto-restart (or a dependent is).
 *
 * When a service stops, any soft dependency links to its dependents must be broken, or otherwise the
 * target state will remain as STARTED and the service will always restart. If the auto-restart option is
 * enabled for the service, or if the service is explicitly being restarted (restart == true), this is
 * actually the desired behaviour, and so in these cases the dependency links are not broken.
 *
 * Force stop
 * ----------
 * A service can be issued a stop-and-take down order (via `stop(true)'); this will first stop
 * dependent services, which may restart and cancel the stop of the former service. However, a
 * service can be force-stopped, which means that its stop process cannot be cancelled (though
 * it may still be put in a desired state of STARTED, meaning it will start immediately upon
 * stopping). Force-stop is achieved via a flag in the service record which is checked before
 * interrupting a stop operation.
 *
 * Pinning
 * -------
 * A service may be "pinned" in either STARTED or STOPPED states (or even both). Once it
 * reaches a pinned state, a service will not leave that state. A service that is pinned
 * STOPPED cannot be started or marked active and any attempt to start it will fail. A service
 * that is pinned STARTED remains started even if the service is not marked active and no other
 * active service depends on it; this is the only scenario in which a service with a required_by
 * count of 0 will remain started. Once unpinned the service will stop.
 *
 * (Note that pinning prevents, but never causes, state transition).
 *
 * The priority of the different state deciders is:
 *  - pins
 *  - force stop flag
 *  - desired state (which is manipulated by require/release operations)
 *
 * So a forced stop cannot occur until the service is not pinned started, for instance. (if
 * pinned, the forced stop remains pending until the pin is released).
 *
 * Two-phase transition
 * --------------------
 * Transition between states occurs in two phases: propagation and execution. In both phases
 * a linked-list queue is used to keep track of which services need processing; this avoids
 * recursion (which would be of unknown depth and therefore liable to cause stack overflow).
 *
 * In the propagation phase, acquisition/release messages are processed, and desired state may be
 * altered accordingly. Start and stop requests are also propagated in this phase. The state may
 * be set to STARTING or STOPPING to reflect the desired state, but will never be set to STARTED
 * or STOPPED (that happens in the execution phase).
 *
 * The two-phase transition is needed to avoid problem where a service that becomes STOPPED has
 * an incorrect acquisition count, which may cause it to restart when it should not. The
 * propagation phase allows the acquisition count to settle before the transition to the STOPPED
 * state occurs, and the decision whether to restart can then be made based on the (correct)
 * acquisition count. See "acquisition/release" above for details of when this can occur.
 *
 * Propagation variables:
 *   prop_acquire:  the service has transitioned to an acquired state and must issue an acquire
 *                  on its dependencies
 *   prop_release:  the service has transitioned to a released state and must issue a release on
 *                  its dependencies.
 *
 *   prop_start:    the service should start
 *   prop_stop:     the service should stop
 *
 * Note that "prop_acquire"/"prop_release" form a pair which cannot both be set at the same time
 * which is enforced via explicit checks. For "prop_start"/"prop_stop" this occurs implicitly.
 *
 * In the execution phase, actions are taken to achieve the desired state. Actual state may
 * transition according to the current and desired states. Processes can be sent signals, etc
 * in order to stop them.

/*
 * A service_set, as the name suggests, manages a set of services.
 *
 * Other than the ability to find services by name, the service set manages various queues.
 * One is the queue for processes wishing to acquire the console. There is also a set of
 * processes that want to start, and another set of those that want to stop. These latter
 * two "queues" (not really queues since their order is not important) are used to prevent too
 * much recursion and to prevent service states from "bouncing" too rapidly.
 * 
 * A service that wishes to start or stop puts itself on the start/stop queue; a service that
 * needs to propagate changes to dependent services or dependencies puts itself on the
 * propagation queue. Any operation that potentially manipulates the queues must be followed
 * by a "process queues" order (processQueues() method).
 *
 * Note that processQueues always repeatedly processes both queues until they are empty. The
 * process is finite because starting a service can never cause services to stop, unless they
 * fail to start, which should cause them to stop semi-permanently.
